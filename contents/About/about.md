If you know me well, you probably already know that I write blogs quite often. Most of the times the blogs I write are technical blogs and sometimes I also write about myself and my preferences. Inspired by **Dan Abramov**, I wanted to create a personal blog website like he has. So, I created this website. That is one reason, however there are many others. So let's talk about it.
<br><br><br>

### Why did I create this website?
At the start of 2019, I promised that I would write at least 52 blogs in the year 2019 through [my blog](https://medium.com/@Prashacharya/looking-back-at-2018-with-commitments-for-2019-100-hrs-work-week-c5e068ed344e) on medium. To fulfill my commitment, I decided to create this website where I will write all of those blogs. <br>

### What will I share through this platform?
This is my personal blog and in this website I want to write anything that I feel like writing. Mostly, I have been writing technical stuffs but not everyone is interested in it but now with this website I also plan to write about my thoughts and emotions about things and other personal things.
<br><br>
### My Next Blog
I am going for TechTrix Hackathon 2019, which is happening tomorrow so I will write hourly summary of what we did in that hour. I will publish it after I return back from the hackathon.
<br><br>
### My next targets for the website
I plan to improvise the SEO of this website and also convert it to a progressive web application so that you can save this website as an app and read contents ofline.


**I want to extend this blog further sometime soon. I will share it in all my social media platforms to keep you updated for it.**
