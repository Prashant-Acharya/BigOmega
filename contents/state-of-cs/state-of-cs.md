Computer Science is the most hyped subject in the world right now. Many people choose Computer Science as their career path which is not a surprise considering the scope it has and the financial benefits it provides. It is not different in the case of Nepal as well but the thing that is different in the context of Nepal is the no of students going abroad to pursue their education in CS just because the education system of Nepal lags behind in few things. In this blog, I don't plan to provide the statistics behind the state of CS in Nepal. I talk more about how colleges & students approach this subject and what companies expect from students. I am not an expert but since I have been interacting with a lot of people who are experienced in this field provides me at least have some authority to express my opinion regarding it. 

## A little background about myself
I study Computer Science and Information Technology at Sagarmatha College of Science and Technology, affiliated to Tribhuvan University which is the first and the largest university of Nepal. At the time of writing, I am in the 4th semester.  

### Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT)
It is the most popular Computer Science course in Nepal. If we look back a few years from now, CSIT is not the ideal choice for students. The results were never in time, the 4-year course would take nearly about 5 years for completion, everyone cursed the exams and the way the papers were checked. The last one about exams is still a problem as the checking is still not satisfactory to a lot of people including me and I am not saying this because I got less than what I expected. I am saying this because I got unexpectedly higher scores than what I expected I would get in one of the exams up to this semester. On the other hand, we can really appreciate the positive things that have been done for the course. Exams are on time, results are published on time, the length of semesters is balanced meaning, not some semester would finish in 3 months and some would take 9 and the most important is the course and the syllabus is updated to try to balance the knowledge the world demands and the course provides. It still has some flaws which I will discuss later in the blog.

### Comparison with other courses
First of all, I have no clue about the exact alternative course to CSIT in Nepal. Maybe Kathmandu University and Pokhara University provide some version of CS/CSIT named something else. So, let's look at some close alternative to CSIT.
#### B.E. Computer
CSIT was always considered to be an inferior course to computer engineering until a few years back. B.E. Computer is also a course a parent would want his/her child to enrol in, instead of computer science because they can add Engineer in their name after they graduate. 

The content wise these course vary to some extent. Computer Engineering focuses on Computer related subjects, some electronics engineering, drawings etc. Theoritically, computer engineering subject should focus on the application part and Computer Science should focus on the science behind how computer works, how some algorithms are working behind the scenes etc.

#### BCA and BIM
BCA is a newer addition to Computer related course on TU. It's full form Bachelor in Computer Application, we can expect from the course. I don't know everything about it but as I have seen the syllabus of the subject I can say a few things about it. It really wants to focus on the application part as it teaches subjects Object Oriented programming with Java, Scripting Languages &  Web Technology etc before the 4th semester. Accounting and Finance are some other subjects the students have to study in the course.
 
BIM is a course that combines business with IT. So the entire course is made up of with a mixture of IT and Business. I would like to say no more about it as I am not completely aware of BIM.

#### Conclusion about courses
I mentioned a few courses related to CS in the context of Nepal. Though the name might be different, a lot of these focus on the same core computer science principle. I also would like to state that the course doesn't really matter and I will explain it a little more, further in the blog.

## The challenges with Computer Science
There are a few reasons that don't let any Computer related course flourish in Nepal in my opinion. All aspects like Colleges, Students and Companies contribute to these challenges equally.
